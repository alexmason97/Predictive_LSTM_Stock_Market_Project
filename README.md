# Predictive Stock Market LSTM Model

Hello and welcome to this notebook. 

The following project was build in a python jupyter notebook. 
The project consists of using a dataset of stock market information from 85 of the
100 companies in 
the NASDAQ 100 list as of July 26th, 2021.

The structure of the project is as follows:
1. Python Imported Packages
2. Data Overview and Loading the Dataset 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis 
4. Data Cleansing/PreProcessing 
5. Model Preparation & Train-Test Split
6. Model Performance Metrics

This project consists of analzing stock market information and finding out useful information
and trends without the datasets, data cleaning using pandas and numpy amd building a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
model using our data to predict stock prices.

The dataset is included as a link in the notebook and explanations of the data cleansing
and data preparation process is also included.

Enjoy!

## Lessons Learned

Q: What did you learn while building this project? 

A: Learned a lot about LSTM models and what goes into building an LSTM model to 
be able to 'look back' at data entries to be able to make predictions on future values.
Also learned quite a bit of tensorflow and model optimization as well

Q: What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

A: Many issues with data manipulation and specific function calls not working due to the datatypes
used in the dataset. Was able to overcome them or figure out work arounds that suited the needs of this project's 
appropriate completion.
